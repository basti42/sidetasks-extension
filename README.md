# Site-Task Browser extension

## What it does
A simple browser extension that makes use of the browsers sidebar component to keep a list of daily tasks. The tasks are only persisted in the browsers localStorage and will be overriden at the latest after a week. Or when a task is completed and it is clicked off. 
The list only shows todays tasks and nothing else.

## How it works
You can toggle the sidebar on or off with the key combination `CTRL+Shift+Y`
